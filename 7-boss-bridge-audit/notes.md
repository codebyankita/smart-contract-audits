Each vault works with 1 token

How signing works:
1. Take private key + message (data, function selector, parameters)
2. Smash it into Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (in a certain format)
1. This outputs v, r, and s 
2. We can use these values to verify someones signature using ecrecover

How verification works:
1. Get the signed message
   2. Break into v, r, s
2. Get the data itself
3. Use it as input parameters for
ecrecover
